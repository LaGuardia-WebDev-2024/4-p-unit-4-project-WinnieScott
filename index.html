  <p id="duck" class="align" >One of the most popular features of Inwood Hill park, this marshy attraction boasts such exotic wildlife as geese, ducks, and even the occasional muskrat. (actually my dad did see a shark in the pond a few weeks ago and there was a seal a few years ago that used to visit often, clevery dubbed "sealy". We found out it was a seal that had been released from the monerey bay aquarium and its real name was Bluebell.) If you are lucky, can may be able to catch the pond at low tide, when exiting features are revealed, such as mud and The Smell. Unfortunately, you are only allowed to observe the ducks from the designated duck observation spot. You can look at the geese from anywhere.</p>

  <p id="ducke">Experiences I have had here: 
  <ul id="ducke">
    <li>My friend fell in during low tide and got stuck in the mud</li>
    <li>Seen many rats</li>
    <li>My dog barked at the water becuase she was confused as to why it was moving</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="baseballt" class="align" >The Lower Baseball Field</h3>

  <img src="https://www.inwoodbaseball.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_7230-scaled.jpg" width="300">

  
  <p id="baseball" class="align" >If you cross over the bridge to the small peninsula, you will see the the lower baseball field and home of the Inwood little league. This destination is where you want to go if you want to see parents being really intense about something that doesn't matter. I myself once played baseball on this very field, for one season before I quit because I was really bad at it and also didn't like it. I was not the worst one on the team but I was definitly down there. I played left field I think. </p>

  <p id="baseballe">Experiences I have had here: 
  <ul id="baseballe">
    <li>Watched  robins pull worms out of the ground and eat them because i was in the outfield and really bored becuase no one on the team was able to hit anything out that far</li>
    <li>Got hit in the back by a baseball while batting (got to walk to first base!)</li>
    <li>Our team was was called "councilman Ydanis Rodriguez" because we were named after whoever sponsored the team. This is not really an experience but I thought I should mention it</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="sledt" class="align" >the sledding hill</h3>

  <img src="https://www.nycgovparks.org/photo_gallery/full_size/9730.jpg" width="300">

 
  <p id="sled" class="align">This next destination serves mostly nostalgia as it does not snow anymore. (way to go climate change). In the winter, hay bales are placed at the bottom of the hill to help frotect sledders from sliding down the hill and hitting a bench. This does not work. Throughout the years, this hill has become more and more dangerous to sled on as a new pine tree is planted on the hill every year. Or maybe it just makes it a fun obstacle course.</p>
 
  <p class="align " id="fact" >FUN FACT! </p>
  <p class="align" id="factt">Infamous escape artist harry houdini's nephew died while sledding on this hill.<br> We honor him by continuing to sled on this hill.</p> <br>
  
  <p id="slede">Experiences I have had here: 
  <ul id="slede">
    <li>Me and my friend crashed in to a tree on a sled</li>
    <li>Made a snowman</li>
    <li>Sledded down the hill and under a bench</li>
  </ul>
