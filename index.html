  <h1>My Unofficial Local Guide to [~~~]</h1>
  
  <h3>The duck pond</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>One of the most popular featurs of inwood hill park, this marshy attraction boasts such exotic wildlife as geese, ducks, and even the occasional muskrat. (actually my dad did see a shark in the pond a few weeks ago and there was a seal a few years ago that used to visit often, clevery dubbed "sealy". We found out it was a seal that had been released from the monerey bay aquarium and its real name was Bluebell.) If you are lucky, can may be able to catch the pond at low tide, when exiting features are revealed, such as mud and The Smell. unfortunately, you are only allowed to observe the ducks from the designated duck observation spot. you can look at the geese from anywhere.</p>

  experiences i have had here: 
  <ul>
    <li>my friend fell in during low tide and got stuck in the mud</li>
    <li>seen many rats</li>
    <li>my dog barked at the water becuase she was confused as to why it was moving</li>
  </ul>
